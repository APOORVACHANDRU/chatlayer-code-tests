# Chatlayer code tests

Welcome to the Chatlayer code tests repo! This repo contains assignments which you may solve using any language, but JavaScript or TypeScript are preferred. You can find the assignments in the `assignments` folder. Each subfolder contains an `assignment.md` file with an in-depth explanation.

Feel free to clone this repo and use it as a starting point for your solutions.

We're excited to see how you'll be tackling these. Good luck and have fun!
